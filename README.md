## ⚙️ Project Overview

This project is a **12V High-Efficiency Class-D Audio Amplifier** designed using **IRF540N MOSFETs** in a **full H-bridge configuration**, driven by **LM393**, **NE555**, and **transistor driver stages**.  
It efficiently converts low-power analog input signals into high-power digital PWM signals, delivering amplified output to the speaker with **minimal power loss** and **excellent sound clarity**.

Unlike traditional two-MOSFET Class-D amplifiers, this design uses an **H-bridge configuration**—similar to motor driver ICs like **L298N or IR2111**—which **doubles output power**, eliminates DC blocking capacitors, and provides **symmetrical drive voltage across the load**.

## ⚡ Working Principle

The circuit works on the **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** principle.  
The **audio input signal** is compared with a **triangle waveform** to generate a **PWM signal**, which switches the MOSFETs at high frequency to reproduce the amplified version of the input sound at the output.

---

## 🔩 Circuit Description

This Class-D amplifier circuit consists of four main stages:

1. **Triangle Wave Generator (NE555)**  
2. **Comparator / Modulator (LM393)**  
3. **Driver Stage (BD139–BD140 or IR2111)**  
4. **H-Bridge Output Stage (IRF540N MOSFETs)**  
5. **LC Low-Pass Filter** to recover the analog output from PWM.

## 🔍 Stage-wise Working

### 1️⃣ Triangle Wave Generator (NE555)
- **IC Used**: NE555 configured as an **astable multivibrator**.  
- **Pins 2 & 6** are connected together and determine the frequency.  
- **Typical Frequency**: ≈ 50 kHz to 100 kHz (as seen at Pin 2/6).  
- Output is a **triangle (or sawtooth-like)** waveform which acts as the **carrier signal**.

### 2️⃣ Pre-Amplifier Stage
- **LM386** or **LM358** (as seen in your circuit) amplifies the small audio input signal to suitable level.  
- Provides DC isolation and improves SNR before feeding into comparator.

### 3️⃣ Comparator / Modulator (LM393)
- The **LM393** compares:
  - **Input Audio Signal** (from preamp)
  - **Triangle Wave** (from NE555)
- The output becomes a **PWM signal**, whose **duty cycle** changes according to the amplitude of the input audio.
- This modulation process converts the analog input into a **digital pulse stream** that contains the same audio information.

### 4️⃣ Driver Stage (BD139–BD140 Pair)
- Two complementary transistors (BD139 NPN, BD140 PNP) boost the current capability of LM393’s output.
- They provide strong gate drive to the MOSFETs, ensuring fast and clean switching transitions.

> Alternative: You can use **IR2111 IC** as a powerful MOSFET driver for higher efficiency and lower switching delay.

### 5️⃣ H-Bridge MOSFET Output Stage
- Four **IRF540N** MOSFETs are arranged in a **full-bridge (H-bridge)** configuration.
- Each pair of MOSFETs operates in complementary mode:
  - One half-bridge drives the speaker positive terminal.
  - The other half drives the negative terminal.
- The output load (speaker) thus receives **alternating polarity PWM**, doubling the effective voltage swing.

### 6️⃣ Output LC Low-Pass Filter
- A combination of **inductor (30µH)** and **capacitor (1uF,450v)** filters the high-frequency PWM into a **smooth analog waveform**.
- The result is a **clean, amplified audio output**.

## 💡 Why H-Bridge Is More Efficient

| Parameter | Simple 2-MOSFET Class-D | H-Bridge Class-D (This Circuit) |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Output Swing | Half of supply (Vcc/2) | Full of supply (±Vcc) |
| Power Delivery | Limited | 2× More Output Power |
| Efficiency | ~75–80% | 90–95% |
| DC Blocking Capacitor | Required | Not Required |
| Speaker Connection | One end to ground | Floating (balanced output) |
| Symmetry | Single-ended | Full-bridge differential drive |
| Thermal Loss | Higher | Lower due to balanced load sharing |

**In short:**  
This amplifier delivers **double the power**, **less heat**, and **better sound clarity**, all while running on just 12V.
